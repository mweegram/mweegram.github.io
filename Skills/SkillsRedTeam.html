            <summary>Penetration Testing</summary>
            <p>During some of my spare time I have experimented a lot with Pen Test based online lab based learning services such as Hack The Box and Try Hack Me. As a result I have picked up a lot of information about the different stages of attack and how this would look to an attacker as opposed to from the blue team side. The labs in these sites cover each of the different stages which are Reconnaissance, Enumeration, Exploitation, Privilege Escalation, (sometimes creating persistence) and Reporting.</p>
            <p>I also learned how to pivot from these labs, this means using an initial breach to move laterally from machine to others, to accomplish this I had to use proxychains (tool), as these machines were not accessable from the hacking machine due to the device I was wanting to pivot to being internal. I was able to accomplish the hacking of many purposely vulnerable machines using Kali Linux and ParrotOS, both of which are industry standard pentesting machines. I have done some personal pentesting too, as someone with software development and scripting skills I have tested my own tools for vulnerabilities before use to ensure they are safe to be implemented.</p>

            <summary>Purple Team Mindset</summary>
            <p>As a result of my practise red teaming, I feel like I have developed a new mindset that I was unable to appreciate beforehand. The new mindset I have is using my understanding as an attacker to benefit my ability to defend networks, this is known as Purple Teaming and is a relatively new concept in industry. Knowing how an attacker may try to accomplish their goals and what tools, techniques and procedures (TTPs) they would use is greatly beneficial. If I know what they want to do and what they can exploit, I know what to look for in logs and can make alerts and detections or suggestions of remediations and prevent any use of particular TTPs.</p>
            <p>The use of TTPs to help me create alerts and detections also has a relation to the MITRE ATT&CK framework which maps TTPs to the nation state actors and advanced persistent threats (APTs) that make use of them. As part of a previous role I have mapped attack vectors and alerts that we recieved to the MITRE framework and have tweaked these alerts to have better coverage of them.</p>

            <summary>Reconnaissance</summary>
            <p>I have used tools such as NMAP to looks for publicly facing open services in networks and servers and have used different parameters and options to achieve different levels of information gathering. For example "nmap -sS *TARGET IP*" to perform a more stealthy Syn scan and "nmap -sCV *TARGET IP*" to get service version, especially useful for finding vulnerable ports and software to get initial access.</p>
            <p>Another area that have developed proficiency is in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT). I have used tools such as Sherlock and Google (via optimised or dorked searches) to gather relevant information which is in the public domain about a target or service and have been able to implement that to learn more about a target. The joy of OSINT is that it is completely free and accessable using resources which are available without the requirement of much effort, usually through a search browser. OSINT is masively underrated. One real world ethical application of OSINT would be using a service like Glassdoor to find out more about an employer before applying. </p>

            <summary>Vulnerability Testing and Management</summary>
            <p>During my time working in purposely vulnerable machines I have often thought about the ways to keep on top of patches and preventing vulnerabilities from being exploited. I have worked to test vulnerabilities on my own machines. Testing SQL Injections on my own sites and then implementing santitisation of the user input taken, so that the site remains interactive but is also safe to be used. I have also implemented methods of patching vulnerable machines to bring them up to date so that they no longer remain vulnerable.</p>

            <summary>Enumeration</summary>
            <p>I have used tools such as WinPEAS, LinPEAS, Nessus and some personal experience and knowledge to enumerate Windows and Linux machines for vulnerabilities, usually for the sake of finding weakpoints in security and also for privilege escaltion. These tools highlight areas where weaknesses are so that they can either be dealt with and remediated or exploited (depending on the intentions of the user).</p>
            <p>In the past I have been able to use LinPEAS and WinPEAS in Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge style labs in order to achieve root and quickly gain access to the flag. There has also been some labs that have been based around using and testing Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, which is a common tool used by modern pen testers, this experience was valuable to see how testing can be automated and be implemented easily into a workflow. Another method of enumeration I have used is directory busting (using Dirbuster and GoBuster), which is finding unlisted directories which may contain files and images that weren't supposed to be exposed to the internet or attacker, such as development directories and databases.</p>

            <summary>Exploit Reading, Writing and Interpretation</summary>
            <p>While I have explored my interest for breaking things and pen testing, I have found myself having to read and interpret publicly available exploits from sites like Exploit(.db). As a result I have become familiar with certain techniques used by exploit writers and APTs alike. One such example of something I have since become familiar with would be Reverse Shells and Bind Shells, which attacks and pen testers use as a method of achieving OS access on a compromised machine, allowing them to control the machine with a certain level of privilege (User or Root).</p>
            <p>I have also created some of these tools myself for testing purposes which i run in isolated Virtual Machines, stuff like my own Reverse Shell, Keylogger and Ransomware (especially important as that is a big threat in the modern threat landscape. A major skill I have achieved in this area is the ability to adapt and customise pre-existing exploits to work in different scenarios and have ported old scripts from different languages and from Python 2 to Python 3.</p>
