          <summary>Important Note</summary>
          <p>Due to my curious nature and natural inclination to tinker, I have picked up a varied array of skills. The following section serves to document as many relevant skills that I have developed throughout my fascination with Cyber Security as possible.</p>

            <summary>Programming/Scripting</summary>
            <p>I have been writing code since I was 15, I started learning Python in school and have continued to develop my knowledge over time. Since starting with Python I have moved into learning other languages such as C++, C#, JavaScript and SQL. My primary focus of my programming has been Python, with it being such a popular language in my focus area of Cybersecurity. I have made many projects with all of the different languages ranging from simple products such as a Python script to query a job application database I had, to an somewhat basic Anti-Malware tool which ran on new files in a filesystem and a USB Rubber Ducky forensicator tool (for some of the more interesting projects see the projects section).</p>
            <p>I am familiar with multiple paradigms of programming such as Functional and Object Oriented Programming. I have been able to apply my skills in this area to create solutions to problems and to automate workflows to make my own life and the life of colleagues easier. An example of doing this was to create a series of script to turn a malicious phishing email into one that could be safely used in-house as part of a test phishing campaign (important as this was a painful hour long task previously and can now be done in seconds). I am constantly looking for ways to improve my current process and use code to reduce the amount of time that I waste or how I could implement a script with the intention to help the productivity of others. I have experience in many different modules and domains, such as USB at firmware level, C++ as OS level and Python at Network level with sockets.</p>
            <p>One other area I have begun to explore is the area of shell scripting for Linux and Windows. I understand the importance shell scripting from automation and also Cybersecurity and have tried to implement it where possible. In the process  of learning how to shell script I have become more familiar with Operating Systems and how they work and how to use their commands in a more effective manor than I could previously.</p>
