          <summary>Important Note</summary>
          <p>Due to my curious nature and natural inclination to tinker, I have picked up a varied array of skills. The following section serves to document as many relevant skills that I have developed throughout my fascination with Cyber Security as possible.</p>

            <summary>Programming/Scripting</summary>
            <p>I have been writing code since I was 15, I started learning Python in school and have continued to develop my knowledge over time. Since starting with Python I have moved into learning other languages such as C++, C#, JavaScript and SQL. My primary focus of my programming has been Python, with it being such a popular language in my focus area of Cybersecurity. I have made many projects with all of the different languages ranging from simple products such as a Python script to query a job application database I had, to an somewhat basic Anti-Malware tool which ran on new files in a filesystem and a USB Rubber Ducky forensicator tool (for some of the more interesting projects see the projects section).</p>
            <p>I am familiar with multiple paradigms of programming such as Functional and Object Oriented Programming. I have been able to apply my skills in this area to create solutions to problems and to automate workflows to make my own life and the life of colleagues easier. An example of doing this was to create a series of script to turn a malicious phishing email into one that could be safely used in-house as part of a test phishing campaign (important as this was a painful hour long task previously and can now be done in seconds). I am constantly looking for ways to improve my current process and use code to reduce the amount of time that I waste or how I could implement a script with the intention to help the productivity of others. I have experience in many different modules and domains, such as USB at firmware level, C++ as OS level and Python at Network level with sockets.</p>
            <p>One other area I have begun to explore is the area of shell scripting for Linux and Windows. I understand the importance shell scripting from automation and also Cybersecurity and have tried to implement it where possible. In the process  of learning how to shell script I have become more familiar with Operating Systems and how they work and how to use their commands in a more effective manor than I could previously.</p>

            <summary>Linux Kernel-based Operating Systems</summary>
            <p>I have accumulated a depth of knowledge for the Linux kernel and operating different operating systems via a command line terminal. I am confident performing an array of tasks, including server deployment, programming and configuration. Equally I am able to use help commands and man pages to fill any gaps in my knowledge. </p>
            <p>Primarily my understanding of the linux kernel and operating systems built on it comes from Kali Linux and Ubuntu, although I have configured others like Alpine OS.Furthermore I have a grasp of hardening or securing Linux machines, having securely configured services like Apache web server, MySQL database, FTP and SMTP in the past as part of my studies.</p>

            <summary>Networking Equipment Deployment</summary>
            <p>As part of my degree, I undertook 3 modules all of which were closely aligned with the CCNA Certification Specification. As a result of these modules and their respective assesment I have gained invaluable experience configuring networking devices such as Routers to create and deploy simulated enterprise environments. As Cisco routers use Cisco IOS on their routers, I have become proficient with configuring IOS to meet client specification.</p>
            <p>I have configured an MPLS cloud, MPLS VPN, Access Control Lists, Extended ACL, IPSec with Encryption and hardened routers, to reduce their attack surface. One of the assesments was to configure a corporate network over three geographically seperate sites and MPLS VPNs to provide access to specified services and revoke access to others.</p>

        <summary>Internet of Things</summary>
        <p>I undertook an optional module at University, which introduced the Internet of Things and allowed me to work as a team to create and present a prototype Internet of Things device which not only worked but helped to solve a real world issue. My team's project was a RFID-based room booking service, with full backend, website and database.</p>
        <p>As part of the content we were taught about real world case studies on the applications of IoT, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and security concerns in the internet of things, which is especially important because of the implications to users of a Cyber attack on a device on their home network. </p>

        <summary>Network Configuration and Management</summary>
        <p>My University course had three modules called network technology 1-3, each of them was mapped to part of the Cisco CCNA Certification. As part of these modules I developed simulated networks (GNS3 and Packet Tracer) to a set design specification. Network technologies used to implement these networks included: MPLS, VLAN (with Trunk Links), Cisco IOS and Access Control Lists (Standard and Extended).</p>

        <summary>Software Source Control (Git, etc)</summary>
        <p>As part of my self-guided study of software design and development I have gathered an understanding for the need and benefits of using source control software like Git. I have begun using source control in my personal projects as well as within university programming projects.</p>
        <p>Git/Github allows me to keep copies of the scripts I create and add to them without breaking or losing the original copies. When making changes I make sure to leave detailed commit messages and create branches to ensure that changes do not have any adverse effects on the main code of the file.</p>
        <p>Git allows for group working on one code base, making sure changes are applied thoughfully. Code reviews and GPG key signed commits are a neccessity when working on group projects to ensure quality and integity of commits respectively.</p>
