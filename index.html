            <p>I am a Cyber Security Professional from Hartlepool, United Kingdom. I have just completed my studies in Computer Networks and Cyber Security at Northumbria Univerity. To find out about work experience and duties, please check my LinkedIn or request a CV via email.</p>
            <p>As a professional, I am always taking steps to better my abilities and improve my capabilities. Looking for new and exciting ways to challenge myself, is something I do whenever the opportunity presents itself. My working style is very flexible, depending more on the situation, than on habit. This means that I always have the right tools and mindset for any project.</p>
            <p>As a person, I love Music, Fitness and Technology. I am always trying to keep up to date with advancements in technology, both in terms of Cyber Security and in general. Currently, I am researching Microcontrollers/Microprocessors and their use cases/applications. I believe in constant improvement and learning from others, especially from their mistakes. For some industry related information I like DefCon hacking convention talks and security related podcasts too.</p>
            <p>Please note, I am not a web developer. Feel free to raise any issues, although I have tried to provide compatibility to as many devices as possible. Learning how to make the site more responsive was a big task in itself.</p>
