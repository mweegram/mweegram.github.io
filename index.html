									<h2>About Me</h2>

										<h3>As a Professional</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										I am a passionate and capable student, my areas of expertise are Cyber Security and Programming. I am currently
										a student at Northumbria University and I am working towards my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Networks and Cyber Security.
										Currently, I am looking to find an Industrial Placement within the Cyber Security sector as I feel that it would give me a good
										opportunity to bridge any gaps in my knowledge by being able to implement knowledge I have attained while in education and put my
										skills and understanding.
									</p>
									<p>
										Beyond University, I hope to pursue a career within Cyber Secuirty. There are multiple areas that have caught my eye, however I
										remain open minded as the industry is developing rapidly and more roles and career paths open up regularly. One area that has really
										caught my interest is Penetration Testing due to the complex nature and scope of possibilities that it entails. In order to achieve
										this I plan to undertake industry recognised certifications to not only show my merit but to develop myself and enrich my knowledge.
									</p>

										<h3>As a Person</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										I believe in learning and developing as much possible and as such like to use some of my available time to better myself and improve
										my skills and abilities. One way that I leverage this philosophy is to keep up to date with Cyber Security news 
										(New/Popular CVEs, New Technologies, Attacks/Breaches) and media like Podcasts. I also like to practise with industry standard tools
										and tactics by practising Ethical Hacking through Capture the Flag challenges (CTF) and also through testing the tools (on my own networks)
										and some times even writing my own.
									</p>
									<p>
										If I am not practising Cyber Security, I also like to practise Programming. During the years that I have been learning I have amassed an
										expansive amount of knowledge in many different languages, although some of them I don't often use or have learned for specific situations.
										Some of the languages that I have experience in include: Python, C++, C, C#, Java and PHP. I also have experience implementing databases and working
										with them using SQL to query the data alongside these languages. The language that I have the most comptetancy in is Python, it was my first language
										and can be used to create anything, including some Cyber Security tools, which is one way that I manage to combine my hobbies and passions.
